            I started by journey over a year ago with taking the Google IT
            certificate program. I finished to program in six months gaining the
            foundational knowledge of all things computer and devices hardware,
            software, troubleshooting and more. After I completed my program I
            thought aboout what specfic IT field that wanted to enter. I
            discovered SheCodes. I took a free coding workshop to see what it
            was all about. I was completely fascinated with everything that Matt
            showed us and shared. In June I became a student. I went from
            knowing bascially nothing about coding to being able to code the
            webpage that you are currently reading, how to use Bootstrap,
            Matlablib and more. Joining SheCodes was the best decison that I
            ever made. I am motivated to finish and to start a new chapter as a
            Junior Developer once I am finished. If you like my work and would
            like for me to potentially work your project please feel free to
            contact me. Have a great one!
